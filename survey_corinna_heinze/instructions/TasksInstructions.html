    <h3>📋 Your task</h3>
    <p>
        👔 You take the role of a <strong>bank employee</strong> who reviews credit applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each applicant, you will see information such as income, debt, and employment details.
        Based on this information, your task is to assess the applicant’s creditworthiness and classify
        the applicant into one of the following categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Poor creditworthiness</li>
        <li>Standard creditworthiness</li>
        <li>Good creditworthiness</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="instruction-note">
        Please take your time and base each decision on the information shown.

    <p>
        Each case consists of two steps:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong>
        You make an initial decision based only on the applicant information.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>
        You then see the AI-support and can keep or revise your decision.
    </p>

    <p class="instruction-note">
        You always make the final decision. The AI provides support, but it does not decide for you.
    </p>
