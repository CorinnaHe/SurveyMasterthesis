<h3>🤖 How the AI system works</h3>

<p>
The AI system is trained on past credit decisions and looks for patterns in financial information, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 71% in evaluation.
</p>

<p>
For each applicant, it considers the same factors that will be shown to you, such as annual income, outstanding debt, and interest rates.
</p>

<p>
The figures below show which applicant characteristics tend to influence the AI’s predictions most strongly.
Features at the top of the plot are generally more important for the AI’s decision than those further down.
</p>

<p>
Each dot represents an applicant from the data used to analyze the model.
Dots further to the left or right indicate a stronger influence on the prediction.
</p>

<p>
Dots on the right side indicate that the feature increased the model’s confidence in the respective class,
while dots on the left side indicate that the feature decreased the confidence in that class.
For example, in the plot for the poor class, points on the right support a prediction of poor creditworthiness,
whereas points on the left speak against it.
</p>

<p>
The color of the dots indicates whether the feature value is relatively low or high
(for example, lower vs. higher annual income).

<h3>How AI support is given</h3>

{% if condition == "C1" %}

<p>
The AI provides a single suggested outcome for the applicant.
Below the suggestion, it shows a frequency-style description (e.g., “82 out of 100 cases”).
</p>

<p>
This description indicates how confident the AI is in its prediction.
It does not guarantee that the suggestion is correct.
The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
</p>


<p class="instruction-note">
    Example of how the AI support is displayed:
</p>

{% include "trial_framework/AI_support_box.html" %}

{% elif condition == "C2" %}

<p>
The AI provides a single suggested outcome together with a confidence level
(low, medium, or high).
</p>

<p>
The confidence level summarizes how confident the model is in its prediction.
It is derived from the predicted probability and grouped into broad categories.
</p>

<p>
A higher confidence does not guarantee correctness.
The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
</p>


<p class="instruction-note">
    Example of how the AI support is displayed:
</p>

{% include "trial_framework/AI_support_box.html" %}

{% elif condition == "C3" %}

<p>
Instead of a single suggestion, the AI shows a set of outcomes it considers plausible, ordered from the most to the least confident item.
The set is constructed so that it is likely to include the correct outcome in 95 of 100 cases.
</p>

<p>
When the set contains more outcomes, the model is less certain.
When it contains fewer outcomes, the model is more confident in its prediction.
The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
