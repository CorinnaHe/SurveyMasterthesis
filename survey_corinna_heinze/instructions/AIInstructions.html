<h3>How the AI system works</h3>

<p>
    The AI system was trained using past credit decisions. It looks at patterns in financial information
    to make its predictions. In past cases, it made the <strong>correct decision for about 71% of applicants </strong>
    and <strong>incorrect decision for about 29%</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    For each applicant the AI looks at the same characteristics that you will see,
    such as annual income, existing debt, and interest rates.

<h3>How AI support is given</h3>

{% if condition == "C1" %}

<p>
    The AI provides a single suggested creditworthiness (poor, good or standard creditworthiness) for the applicant.
    Below the suggestion, it shows a frequency-style description (e.g., “82 of 100 similar cases”).
</p>

<p>
    This description reflects how confident the AI is in its prediction.
    However, this does not guarantee that the prediction is correct in this specific case.
    The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
</p>


<p class="instruction-note">
    Example of how the AI support is displayed:
</p>

{% include "trial_framework/AI_support_box.html" %}

{% elif condition == "C2" %}

<p>
    The AI provides a single suggested creditworthiness (poor, good or standard creditworthiness) for the applicant,
    together with a confidence level (low, medium, or high).
</p>

<p>
The confidence level summarizes how confident the model is in its prediction.
It is derived from the predicted probability and grouped into broad categories.
</p>

<p>
A higher confidence does not guarantee correctness.
The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
</p>


<p class="instruction-note">
    Example of how the AI support is displayed:
</p>

{% include "trial_framework/AI_support_box.html" %}

{% elif condition == "C3" %}

<p>
Instead of a single suggestion, the AI shows a set of creditworthiness levels (poor, standard, good) it considers plausible, ordered from the most to the least confident item.
The set is constructed so that it is likely to include the correct outcome in 95 of 100 cases.
</p>

<p>
When the set contains more levels, the model is less certain.
When it contains fewer levels, the model is more confident in its prediction.
The AI support provides additional information that you may consider when making your final decision.
