<h2>Your Task</h2>

<p>
In this study, you will take the role of a bank employee assessing credit applications.
</p>

<p>
In each case, you will see information about an applicant, such as income, debt, and employment details.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to classify each applicant into one of the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Poor creditworthiness</li>
    <li>Standard creditworthiness</li>
    <li>Good creditworthiness</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please make each decision carefully based on the information shown.
</p>

<h3>How Each Case Works</h3>

<p>
Each case consists of <strong>two stages</strong>:
</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong><br>
You will first make a decision <strong>based only on the applicant information</strong>, without any AI support.
</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong><br>
After that, you will see an <strong>AI-based assessment</strong> of the same case.
You can then <strong>keep or change</strong> your decision.
</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>
You always make the <strong>final decision</strong>.<br>
The AI provides support, but it does not decide for you.

<h3>Applicant Information Overview</h3>

<p>
In each case, you will be shown information about an applicant.
Below is an overview of the types of information you will see and what they represent.
</p>

<p><strong>Sociodemographic information</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Age of the individual in years</li>
    <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Occupational category of the individual</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Financial situation</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Annual income:</strong> Annual gross income of the individual</li>
    <li><strong>Outstanding debt:</strong> Total amount of outstanding financial liabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly balance:</strong> Average monthly account balance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit-related information</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Number of credit cards:</strong> Number of credit cards currently held</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interest rate:</strong>
        The percentage charged on the applicant’s existing credit, which determines how much extra they have to pay on borrowed money over time.
        A higher interest rate means borrowing is more expensive for the applicant.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>About the AI System</h3>

<p>
The AI system is trained on past credit decisions and looks for patterns in financial information.
</p>

<p>
For each applicant, it considers the same factors that will be shown to you, such as annual income, outstanding debt, and interest rates.
</p>

<p>
Some factors tend to influence the AI’s assessment more strongly than others.
The visualization below shows the <strong>most influential factors on average across many cases</strong>.
</p>

<p><em><img src="{{ static 'images/shap_summary_bar.png' }}" alt="SHAP values" style="width:80%"></em></p>

<p>
Importantly, the AI does <strong>not always make correct predictions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Your task is therefore <strong>not</strong> to follow the AI automatically,
but to use its assessment as <strong>decision support</strong> when making your final judgment.

<h3>How the AI Communicates Its Assessment</h3>

{% if condition == "C1" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>single suggested outcome</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Along with this suggestion, the model reports
<strong>how often predictions of this type were correct in similar past cases</strong>,
using a frequency-based description (for example, “82 out of 100 cases”).
</p>

<p>
This information reflects the model’s <strong>uncertainty based on past data</strong>,
not a guarantee for the current case.
</p>

<p>
The model can make mistakes. You should therefore rely on your
<strong>own judgment</strong> and make the final decision.
</p>

{% elif condition == "C2" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>single suggested outcome</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the model communicates its uncertainty using a
<strong>qualitative confidence category</strong>
(<em>low</em>, <em>medium</em>, or <em>high</em> confidence).
</p>

<p>
These confidence categories summarize how certain the model is about its prediction
based on similar past cases, but they do <strong>not guarantee correctness</strong>
for the current decision.
</p>

<p>
The model can be wrong. You should use your <strong>own judgment</strong> and make the final decision,
even if you disagree with the AI’s suggestion.
</p>

{% elif condition == "C3" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>set of multiple outcomes</strong> that it considers
<strong>plausible</strong>, rather than recommending a single outcome.
</p>

<p>
The model has been evaluated on similar past cases. In about
<strong>95 out of 100 cases</strong>, the true outcome was
<strong>included in the set</strong> shown by the model.
</p>

<p>
When the AI presents <strong>more possible outcomes</strong>, this indicates that the case is
<strong>more uncertain for the model</strong>.
When it presents <strong>fewer outcomes</strong>, the model is
<strong>more confident</strong> based on similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to make the final decision using your <strong>own judgment</strong>,
considering the set as decision support rather than a single recommendation.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Note: The order of outcomes reflects how strongly the model associates them with the case,
but all listed outcomes should be considered plausible.
</em>
