<h2>Your Task</h2>

<p>
In this study, you will take the role of a bank employee assessing credit applications.
</p>

<p>
In each case, you will see information about an applicant, such as income, debt, and employment details.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to classify each applicant into one of the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Poor creditworthiness</li>
    <li>Standard creditworthiness</li>
    <li>Good creditworthiness</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please make each decision carefully based on the information shown.
</p>

<h3>How Each Case Works</h3>

<p>
Each case consists of <strong>two stages</strong>:
</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong><br>
You will first make a decision <strong>based only on the applicant information</strong>, without any AI support.
</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong><br>
After that, you will see an <strong>AI-based assessment</strong> of the same case.
You can then <strong>keep or change</strong> your decision.
</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>
You always make the <strong>final decision</strong>.<br>
The AI provides support, but it does not decide for you.

<h3>Applicant Information Overview</h3>

<p>
In each case, you will be shown information about an applicant.
Below is an overview of the types of information you will see and what they represent.
</p>

<p><strong>Sociodemographic information</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Age of the individual in years</li>
    <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Occupational category of the individual</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Financial situation</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Annual income:</strong> Annual gross income of the individual</li>
    <li><strong>Outstanding debt:</strong> Total amount of outstanding financial liabilities</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly balance:</strong> Average monthly account balance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit-related information</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Number of credit cards:</strong> Number of credit cards currently held</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interest rate:</strong>
        The percentage charged on the applicant’s existing credit, which determines how much extra they have to pay on borrowed money over time.
        A higher interest rate means borrowing is more expensive for the applicant.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>About the AI System</h3>

<p>
The AI system is trained on past credit decisions and looks for patterns in financial information.
</p>

<p>
For each applicant, it considers the same factors that will be shown to you, such as annual income, outstanding debt, and interest rates.
</p>

<p>
Some factors tend to influence the AI’s assessment more strongly than others.
The visualization below shows the <strong>most influential factors on average across many cases</strong>.
</p>

<!-- Placeholder for image -->
<p><em>[Visualization of influential factors will be shown here]</em></p>

<p>
Importantly, the AI does <strong>not always make correct predictions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Your task is therefore <strong>not</strong> to follow the AI automatically,
but to use its assessment as <strong>decision support</strong> when making your final judgment.

<h3>How the AI Communicates Its Assessment</h3>

{% if condition == "C1" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>single suggested outcome</strong> that it considers most likely.
</p>

<p>
The model does <strong>not always make correct predictions</strong>, and its suggestion may be wrong in some cases.
</p>

{% elif condition == "C2" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from data.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>single suggested outcome</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the model reports how often this type of prediction is expected to be correct
<strong>in similar situations</strong>, using a frequency-based description.
</p>

<p>
For example, “82 out of 100 cases” means that, in situations like this one,
the model’s suggestion is expected to be correct in about 82 cases and incorrect in about 18 cases.
</p>

<p>
This information describes the model’s <strong>uncertainty about its prediction</strong>,
not a guarantee for this specific decision.
</p>

<p>
In each case, you should use your <strong>own judgment</strong> and make the final decision,
even if you disagree with the AI’s suggestion.
</p>

{% elif condition == "C3" %}

<p>
To assist your decision, an AI model has been trained to assess applicants based on patterns learned from similar past cases.
</p>

<p>
For each case, the model provides a <strong>shortlist of possible outcomes</strong> that it considers plausible.
</p>

<p>
The model has been tested, and in <strong>95 of 100 similar past cases</strong>,
the true outcome was <strong>included in this shortlist</strong>.
</p>

<p>
When the AI presents <strong>more possible outcomes</strong>, this reflects that the case is
<strong>more ambiguous for the model</strong>, based on similar past cases.
When it presents <strong>fewer outcomes</strong>, the model is <strong>more selective</strong> in its suggestions.
</p>

<p>
The order of the outcomes does <strong>not</strong> indicate which answer is most likely,
so please consider all of the options equally.
