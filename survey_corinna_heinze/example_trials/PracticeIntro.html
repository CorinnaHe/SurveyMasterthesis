<h3>Practice Tasks</h3>

<p>
You will now complete <strong>3 example tasks</strong> to familiarize yourself with the task and the AI system.
</p>

<p>
These example tasks are <strong>for practice only</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Your decisions in these tasks do not count toward the main study
and will not affect any outcomes.
</p>

<p>
During the practice tasks, you will receive feedback on whether your decision was correct.
This feedback is provided to support learning and familiarization.
No such feedback will be given in the main study.
</p>

<p>
After completing these practice tasks, the actual study will begin.
